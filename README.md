# ADCScope
ADCScope (Analog to Digital Converter Scope) is a web-based application for use with arbitrary ADCs to display real-time traces of their readout.

Much inspiration was taken from Stefan Ritt's [WaveDAQ](https://elog.psi.ch/scope) system.
This project has updated it through the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) framework, using the [vx](https://github.com/hshoff/vx) library to facilitate sufficient refresh rates.

It is currently still under development.
